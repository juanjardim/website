                    <p>
                        I am a highly driven Salesforce Engineering Team Lead and 15x Certified Architect, blending deep
                        technical mastery with proven strategic leadership. My mission is to drive digital
                        transformation by creating scalable, resilient systems and fostering high-performance
                        engineering cultures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my current capacity, I lead a team of Salesforce engineers, focusing on the strategic future
                        of the Salesforce ecosystem. I spearhead the adoption of cutting-edge technologies, including
                        Salesforce AI (Agentforce) and Data Cloud, and leverage tools like ApexGuru to ensure code
                        quality and stability.
                    </p>
                    <p>My leadership style is informed by my background as an Invited Assistant Professor. I champion a
                        culture of continuous learning, owning the full Agile/Scrum process and implementing
                        knowledge-sharing sessions. I focus on coaching teams and have proven resilient leadership,
                        successfully maintaining morale and business continuity during high-pressure organizational
                        restructuring.
                    </p>
